June Project 2 Notes:
-practiced using sass to generate stylesheets
-worked on getting a basic homepage which uses responsive web design (Bootstrap)
-used web font cdn
-made another nav that collapses on smaller screens, took notes to make this quicker
-card elements set to be 2 per col on large screens, 1 per col on small


-getting better at accounting for responsive elements and how things will appear on small screens
-sass has been going much better than css, makes it easier to widely apply changes
-sass mixins have been very convenient, I should remember to save variables as well for quick colors
-good practice trying to make text distinct from images
-remember display-# sizes are very useful for heading elements
