June 2021 Project Notes

OVERVIEW:
-small site (5 pages) for fictional bougie restaurant
-Pages: Home, Menu, Locations, Merch, Contact
-use bootstrap and js (copy techniques from Better Buzz's site for jquery effects)
-set proper media queries to adhere to mobile-first dev
-look up how to use sass mixins for color choices
-logo at top above topnav (make sure nav is cleaner than you normally do)
-footer at bottom with social media icons and contact

PLAN:
-set javascript / jquery events for showy web effects (it's been a while, re-learn)
-use sass mixins to make colors more appealing (watch a tutorial for this)
-final images, logos, etc

JQUERY EFFECTS TO CONSIDER:
-highlight images transparent gray on hover
-have "More Info" appear with hover as well
-text color change on hover to denote clickable
-maybe a text effect or animation on click
